# PickedFor.me - AI Travel Planning Assistant

An intelligent travel planning application that understands user intent through conversational AI to create personalized trip recommendations.

## 🚀 Project Overview

PickedFor.me uses advanced AI to have natural conversations with users about their travel preferences, understanding not just where they want to go, but why they're traveling, who they're with, and what experiences they're seeking. The app learns from user choices to provide increasingly personalized recommendations.
